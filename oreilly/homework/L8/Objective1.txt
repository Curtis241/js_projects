Objective 1:

Write a function that takes one or more arguments and turns them into an HTML list. The first argument to the function will be the kind of list you are making (that is, a <ul> or a <ol> list), and all the rest of the arguments will be the list items (that, is the strings that will go into <li> elements).

For example, I might call this function like this:

makeList("ul", "apples", "oranges", "pears");

and get this result:

<ul><li>apples</li><li>oranges</li><li>pears</li></ul>        

You can start with this skeleton code:

<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <title> Make an HTML list </title>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <script>

    // your code here
    
    window.onload = function() {
        var list = makeList("ul", "apples", "oranges", "pears");
        var theListDiv = document.getElementById("theList");
        theListDiv.innerHTML = list;
    }
  </script>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="theList"></div>
</body>
</html>        

Save the file in your /AdvJS folder as makeList.html. Comment your code liberally! When the project is working to your satisfaction, hand in makeList.html

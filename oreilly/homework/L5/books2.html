        /*
          1. Do we still need the genre property?

            Yes. I think the genre property is necessary.


          2. Which method of creating books do you prefer?

             I think the genre property is necessary because it makes the code simpler.
             In the section below I would have to add another if statement to filter another book type.
             By adding the genre property I can simply have one line.

             bookItem.setAttribute("class",book.genre);


          3. Can you see advantages of one way over the other?

             I think using the prototype chain works very well when there are methods that need to be different over the same data.
             In the lesson, the Square object had a getArea method and the Circle had a getCircumference method but they both had an
             area property. In this example the only difference is the genre property, which is not enough to justify creating a new object type.

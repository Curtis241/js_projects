Objective 2:

For this project, you'll modify the previous program to create book objects from multiple constructors,
one for each genre type. So, for example, you could have a MysteryBook() constructor to create mystery books,
and a BiographyBook() constructor to create biography books.
Each book will have the same properties as before: genre, title, author, published, hasMovie, display() and toString().

Again, use a window.onload handler function to create an array of book objects, and add each book to the page using the addToPage() function (below). Create a new file in your /AdvJS folder, books2.html, and use the following HTML and JavaScript to get started:

<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <title> Object Prototypes Project : Books, 2 </title>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <style>
    .mystery {
      background-color: rosybrown;
    }
    .biography {
      background-color: mistyrose;
    }
  </style>
  <script>
  
    // your code here for the Book() constructor

    window.onload = function() {
        var books = [ ];
        // your code here to create the books and call addToPage()
    };

    function addToPage(book) {
        var booksList = document.getElementById("books");
        var bookItem = document.createElement("li");

        // your code here to figure out how which class to add to the book
        // you can use: bookItem.setAttribute("class", "mystery") to add the mystery class
        // and: bookItem.setAttribute("class", "biography") to add the biography class
                
        bookItem.innerHTML = book.toString();
        booksList.appendChild(bookItem);
    }  
  </script>
</head>
<body>
<ul id="books">
</ul>
</body>
</html>        

When the project is working to your satisfaction, hand in books2.html

Again, feel free to add more types of books other than mystery and biography, and again, think about which properties go into the
various book constructors, and which go in the prototypes, and why? What other changes did you make to make to your code and why?
Add some comments to your code that explain your changes.

Notice the difference between using one type of constructor to create all the books and using the genre property to distinguish
between the type of book, and having multiple types of books (by using a different constructor for each book).
Do we still need the genre property? Which method of creating books do you prefer? Can you see advantages of one way over the other?
Again, add some comments to your code that describe this.



<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en"><body><script>
var Person = function(){this.bar = 'bar'};
Person.prototype.foo = 'foo';
var Chef = function(){this.goo = 'goo'};
Chef.prototype = new Person();
var cody = new Chef();
console.log(cody.foo); // logs 'foo'
console.log(cody.goo); // logs 'goo'
console.log(cody.bar); // logs 'bar'
</script></body></html>

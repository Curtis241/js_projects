Objective 1:

In this project, you'll build a very simple music game. We've begun the code for you below; you just need to finish it up (and perhaps, clean it up a bit too!).

The game works like this: you click on note buttons to create a chord. Each time you click on a note, add the note to the "notesDisplay" (an input text area).
After three notes, the code should check to see if the string you've entered is a valid major chord (we won't use sharps and flats for this project,
so the only valid chords for our purposes are C, F, and G, though you could add more). After checking, it should display a message in the
"message" <div> (replacing the existing text), and reset the form for the next chord.

The goal for this project is to think about how to organize your code, and as you build it, to understand the scope of each function and variable you use.
Comment your code to briefly describe your organization decisions, as well as the scope of the key variables and functions.

Save the file in your /AdvJS folder as notesGame.html. Here is what the screen will look like after you enter a valid chord, before the form is reset for the next chord:

After completing the project, turn in the file notesGame.html.
